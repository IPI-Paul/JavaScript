[Data Visualization with D3, JavaScript, React - Full Course 2021](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2LhoCfjm8R4)

I have long been thinking of ways to improve my Office VBA pop-ups and produce data driven and dynamic visuals to add to the interactive tables already achieved.

This course by Curran Kelleher gave me the insight and hands on experience to feel confident in achieving these goals.

As usual, I prefer not to be connected to the internet whilst studying. So this meant I was not able to take advantage of VizHub. And, as I was using a Python App to serve all http requests, I was not using react with a node server and only able to rely on the downloaded scripts used in the HTML script tag sources.

As react does not play nice with JavaScript when it comes to Hooks, I developed my own script module to provide useState and useRef Hooks to enable me to continue with the course. I probably made a terrible job of it security wise, as this was my 1st ever attempt at creating Hooks and working with react-dom.

I am now giving the [2022](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xkBheRZTkaw) course a go and Curran has promised.... no dependencies other than D3. Therefore, hopefully no security risks with me trying to develop hooks to replace those offered by react.

I found that rollup and rollup-plugin-jsx also made this all posible.

All data is available at [github/curran](https://github.com/curran) and scripts, as explained in Curran's tutorials, are avalaible from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com). I have copied the source files used to '_Source Files and Scripts', but you will have to put them back in to the same structure the LocalHost links use when serving them and running the code.

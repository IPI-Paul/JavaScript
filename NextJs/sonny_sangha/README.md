Sonny Sangha's [NEXT.JS Crash Course for Beginners - Build 6 Apps in 17 Hours (SSR, Auth, Full-Stack & More) 2022.mp4](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6fNy0iD3hsk).

## Challenges

 - Doing the course without internet access meant I had to create wrappers to use MySQL as the database instead of the firebase used in the course.
 - Creating wrappers to use the same syntax provided in the course.
 - Trying to get React to re-render to show the results of my wrappers and also not continuously re-render until the system crashed.
 - For hulu and google search, making use of the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) api to search my linux file system and return results in the same structure.

## Achievements

 This course helped me learn alot, though some of the challenges took me quite a while to overcome. My version of the hulu and google search projects are functions I could use daily, as the Python project I developed to use in watching tutorials does not give me the ability to see a thumbnail of the video listed and the other Python project I developed to do file searches does not produce a web page result.

## Would Like

 - Better understanding of how to trigger re-rendering from a wrapper

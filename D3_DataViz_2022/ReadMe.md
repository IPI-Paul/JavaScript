[Data Visualization with D3 - Full Course 2022](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2LhoCfjm8R4)

Another very useful course from Curran Kelleher! Not needing to rely on React was a plus, as the software I requirements are not always met by those allowed at work. As a lot of this course related to a high demand at work, it was even better to later find that rather than using rollup.js I could just stick to plain javascript.

As usual, I stuck to not being connected to the internet whilst studying and because the course was geared towards pure JavaScript and D3 only I did not come accross obstacles that could not be overcome.

I was hoping to learn how to have tooltips that behave similar to Power BI and Tableau tooltips, where you could embed a column chart or table in the tooltip. But, I guess that will be for another day.

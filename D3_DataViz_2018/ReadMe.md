[Data Visualization with D3 - Full Course 2018](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_8V5o2UHG0E)

Another great course by Curran Kelleher. In my usual manner, I followed along by converting what I could to run on my computer and not needing to connect to the internet.

I now feel a bit more confident, as I have done 3 courses starting with 2021, then 2022 and now 2018. So, unlike Curran you may notice my coding style changes (hopefully improves) in that order.

Although my initial course work whilst following Currans tutorials all used localhost connections to data saved in the file system. I have managed to use some of the tricks Curran displayed to change each instance of calling data. If the page being viewed has a URL of file:// then the source data is loaded as a javascript object or array. Otherwise it is loaded using relative paths.

All data is available at [github/curran](https://github.com/curran) and scripts, as explained in Curran's tutorials, are avalaible from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com)
